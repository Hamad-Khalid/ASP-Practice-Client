MVC:

- MVC stands for: Models (information entities), Views (User Interfaces)
& Controllers (actions to be executed)

- MVC apps are devided into folders following that idea, along with other necessary folders

- In MVC we don`t use <% %> instead we use @{ Code } to perform some code 
or @ElementX.atrributeY to get the value of attributeY of ElementX


Views:

- All pages inherit _ViewStart.cshtml, which basically is setting the layout of the page to some layout file.

Controllers:

- ActionLink is a function that takes three parameters, first is the string to be displayed on the link,
second is the action (method) to be called and third is the controller whithin which is that action.

- View() is a function that returns the view related to that action (method)

Models:

- Through Entity Framework, it is possible to automatically create DB tables using our model
definitions. To acheive this there is some helpful commands and tricks. One of which is that
a property that has the name of the class and 'id' within its name will be automatically 
treated as PK, or we can use command [key] to annotate that. A Strings are created as a maximum
length varchar(NVARCHARMAX), to define a Max Length we can use [MaxLength = 255] before the property definition
