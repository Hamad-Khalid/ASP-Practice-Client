MVC:

- MVC stands for: Models (information entities), Views (User Interfaces)
& Controllers (actions to be executed)

- MVC apps are devided into folders following that idea, along with other necessary folders

- In MVC we don`t use <% %> instead we use @{ Code } to perform some code 
or @ElementX.atrributeY to get the value of attributeY of ElementX

Views:
- All pages inherit _ViewStart.cshtml, which basically is setting the layout of the page 
to _Layout,cshtml
