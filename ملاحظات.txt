classes:

- To access items in project B from project A, B must be referenced by A
and the referenced class must be public.

- We can also access the contents of a library or a project (B) from project A using 
the compiled version of B only, without a need to move B entirely.
That is done by compiling B and referencing its .dll in A`s references.

- Access Modifiers:
	Public: it can be accessed by any class
	Internal: it can be accessed by other classes within the same project 
	Private: it can be accessed wthin its class
	Protected: it can be accessed by its class and all child classes

- Methods that might be overriden must use the keyword Virtual in the base (parent) class
